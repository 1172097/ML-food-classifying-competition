# ML-food-classifying-competition
The semester long project/competition of CSC311

This repository contains our submission for the semester-long project and competition in CSC311. The objective of the project was to build a machine learning model to classify types of food based on provided features such as the number of ingredients, cost, the setting in which the food is typically served, and more.

A key constraint of the competition was that no external libraries were allowed in the final prediction scriptâ€”all logic, from preprocessing to prediction, had to be implemented from scratch using only built-in Python functionality.

Much of this project focused on data engineering/cleaning and preparing the data, followed by analyzing the performance of various model types and tweaking both the data and model parameters to improve accuracy.
